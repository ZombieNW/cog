# What?
I read this neat [article by Mihail Eric](https://www.mihaileric.com/The-Emperor-Has-No-Clothes/) about building a Claude-Code-Like in ~200 lines of code. I followed along and then decided to re-implement and expand in [Bun](https://bun.com/).

# How?
Install [Bun](https://bun.com/)
```bash
bun install
bun run ./index.ts
```
